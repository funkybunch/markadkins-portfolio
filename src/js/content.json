I was accepted into the Interactive Design program within SMAD and the next 4 years were set. Technology and how things worked continued to fascinate me. I believed then (and still do) that technology and design need to be <strong>tightly coupled to be innovative</strong>.</p><p>To better <strong>understand technology</strong> and how to put <strong>experiences into practice</strong> I added a Computer Science minor. This has proven to be invaluable <strong>cross-functional knowledge</strong> time and time again in <strong>collaborating between teams</strong> and ensuring <strong>effective communication</strong> between designers, researchers, and developers.</p>"}]}},{"id":2,"attributes":{"institution":"Georgia Institute of Technology","index":2,"createdAt":"2022-12-27T22:59:46.895Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-27T23:07:06.672Z","publishedAt":"2022-12-27T23:07:06.659Z","hero":{"id":2,"theme":"dark","heroContent":"<p>Georgia Institute of Technology is a world-leading technical &amp; research university in downtown Atlanta, Georgia.</p>","heroContentSubline":"Expected Graduation 2024","title":"Georgia Tech","brand":{"data":{"id":2,"attributes":{"name":"education_graduate_logo_dark.svg","alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"width":128,"height":54,"formats":{},"hash":"education_graduate_logo_dark_0e8aef6a5b_0a157a5978","ext":".svg","mime":"image/svg+xml","size":3.15,"url":"https://s3.adkins.coffee/portfolio/education_graduate_logo_dark_0e8aef6a5b_0a157a5978.svg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2022-12-27T22:57:35.553Z","updatedAt":"2024-06-06T22:14:24.347Z"}}},"background":{"data":{"id":3,"attributes":{"name":"gatech_bkg_260ccce245.jpeg","alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"width":5184,"height":3456,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_gatech_bkg_260ccce245.jpeg","hash":"thumbnail_gatech_bkg_260ccce245_b0e27dd1a6","ext":".jpeg","mime":"image/jpeg","path":null,"width":234,"height":156,"size":8.83,"url":"https://mark-adkins-portfolio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/thumbnail_gatech_bkg_260ccce245_b0e27dd1a6.jpeg"},"medium":{"name":"medium_gatech_bkg_260ccce245.jpeg","hash":"medium_gatech_bkg_260ccce245_b0e27dd1a6","ext":".jpeg","mime":"image/jpeg","path":null,"width":750,"height":500,"size":53.84,"url":"https://mark-adkins-portfolio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/medium_gatech_bkg_260ccce245_b0e27dd1a6.jpeg"},"small":{"name":"small_gatech_bkg_260ccce245.jpeg","hash":"small_gatech_bkg_260ccce245_b0e27dd1a6","ext":".jpeg","mime":"image/jpeg","path":null,"width":500,"height":333,"size":27.83,"url":"https://mark-adkins-portfolio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/small_gatech_bkg_260ccce245_b0e27dd1a6.jpeg"},"large":{"name":"large_gatech_bkg_260ccce245.jpeg","hash":"large_gatech_bkg_260ccce245_b0e27dd1a6","ext":".jpeg","mime":"image/jpeg","path":null,"width":1000,"height":667,"size":88.16,"url":"https://mark-adkins-portfolio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/large_gatech_bkg_260ccce245_b0e27dd1a6.jpeg"}},"hash":"gatech_bkg_260ccce245_b0e27dd1a6","ext":".jpeg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":2720.99,"url":"https://mark-adkins-portfolio.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/gatech_bkg_260ccce245_b0e27dd1a6.jpeg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"createdAt":"2022-12-27T22:58:30.526Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-27T22:58:30.526Z"}}}},"Callout":[{"id":1,"__component":"layout.callout-items","title":"What I'm Studying","callout_list_item":[{"id":1,"name":"Degree","class":"gt-gold","index":0,"subtitle":"Master's of Science"},{"id":2,"name":"Field","class":"gt-blue","index":1,"subtitle":"Computer Science"},{"id":3,"name":"Specialization","class":"gt-orange","index":2,"subtitle":"Interactive Intelligence"}]}],"content_block":[{"id":2,"title":"Graduate Studies","description":"<p>In January of 2020 I started graduate school, pursuing a <strong>Masters of Science</strong> in Computer Science at the <strong>Georgia Institute of Technology</strong>.
